## 10.0.0

### Major Changes

- af69c14: üö® **Breaking:** Underlying `tabbable` dependency has been updated to v6.0.0 and contains a breaking change related to detached nodes with its default `displayCheck` setting. See tabbable's [changelog](https://github.com/focus-trap/tabbable/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#600) for more information.
  - The `focus-trap` dependency has also be updated to v7.0.0 but only contains the underlying `tabbable` changes.
  - The `tabbableOptions.displayCheck` prop type has been updated to include the new "legacy-full" option.
- 018732c: üö® **Breaking:** Dropped support of IE browsers, all versions.
  - IE11 was [officially retired](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2022/06/15/internet-explorer-11-has-retired-and-is-officially-out-of-support-what-you-need-to-know/) on June 15, 2022 (6 weeks ago). There are no longer any versions of IE that are still maintained or even supported by Microsoft.
- 018732c: Revised and clarified official browser support (still as broad and deep as _reasonably_ possible).

### Patch Changes

- b0bbbd4: Update README with a note about the `children` prop stating that the trap requires a single child, and that if a component is used, it must be a **functional** component that forwards refs.

## 9.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 4d8e041: Fix an issue when running in strict mode which has React immediately unmount/remount the trap, causing it to deactivate and then have to reactivate (per existing component state) on the remount. [#720](https://github.com/focus-trap/focus-trap-react/issues/720)

## 9.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 2d6cd9b: Add explicit dependency on tabbable since the source directly requires it.

## 9.0.0

### Major Changes

- 4a77d87: Stop using the infamous `findDOMNode()` on provided `containerElements`.
  - There seems to have been no good reason for this as this prop, if specified, is already required to be an array of HTMLElement references, which means these nodes have already been rendered (if they were once React elements). There appears to have been no remaining need for this API.
  - Furthermore, the minimum supported version of React is now 16.3 as it technically has been for a while now since that is the version that introduced callback refs, which we've been using for quite some time now (so this bump will hopefully not cause any ripples).

## 8.11.3

### Patch Changes

- 9947461: Bump focus-trap dependency to v6.9.4 to get typings fix.
- 519e5a5: Fix setReturnFocus option as function not being passed node focused prior to activation.

## 8.11.2

### Patch Changes

- 7547d93: Bumps focus-trap to v6.9.3 to pick-up some small bug fixes from underlying tabbable.

## 8.11.1

### Patch Changes

- 040813a: Bumps focus-trap to v6.9.1 to pick-up a fix to tabbable in v5.3.2 regarding the `displayCheck=full` (default) option behavior that caused issues with detached nodes.

## 8.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 7495680: Bump focus-trap to v6.9.0 to get bug fixes and new features to help fix some bugs.

### Patch Changes

- 7495680: Fix onDeactivate, onPostDeactivate, and checkCanReturnFocus options not being called consistently on deactivation.
- 7495680: Fix focus not being allowed to remain on outside node post-deactivation when `clickOutsideDeactivates` is true or returns true.

## 8.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 659d44e: Bumps focus-trap to v6.8.1. The big new feature is opt-in Shadow DOM support in focus-trap (in tabbable), and new tabbable options exposed in a new `focusTrapOptions.tabbableOptions` configuration option.
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è This will likely break your tests **if you're using JSDom** (e.g. with Jest). See [testing in JSDom](./README.md#testing-in-jsdom) for more info.

## 8.9.2

### Patch Changes

- 83e283c: Update focus-trap to v6.7.3 for bug fix related to elements with a negative `tabindex`.

## 8.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 3eb9421: Bump focus-trap to v6.7.2 for bug fix.

## 8.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 83097a5: Delay trap creation until it should be active. This is a change in behavior, however it should not break existing behavior. The delay now allows you to set `active=false` until you have the `focusTrapOptions` set correctly. [#539](https://github.com/focus-trap/focus-trap-react/issues/539)

### Patch Changes

- 16d1ae1: Fix bug where global document was being accessed instead of first checking for `focusTrapOptions.document` option. [#539](https://github.com/focus-trap/focus-trap-react/issues/539)

## 8.8.2

### Patch Changes

- 08a9449: Use `preventScroll` option on deactivation if returning focus.

## 8.8.1

### Patch Changes

- a2806a0: Fix SSR issues when accessing `document` object (#482)

## 8.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 5ee587c: Bump focus-trap dependency to v6.7.1

## 8.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 111a27f: Update focus-trap to v6.6.1, to get tabbable at v5.2.1, to get bug fix for disabled fieldsets.

## 8.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 7fbe8ca: Update to support new features in `focus-trap@6.6.0` including `initialFocus` which can now be false to prevent initial focus, and `escapeDeactivates` which can now alternately be a function that returns a boolean instead of a straight boolean.

## 8.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 5292ae8:
  - Adding support for new focus-trap options from focus-trap v6.5.0: `checkCanFocusTrap()`, `onPostActivate()`, `checkCanReturnFocus()`, and `onPostDeactivate()`.
  - Adding support (bug fix) for existing focus-trap `setReturnFocus` option that had thus far been ignored, with focus-trap-react always returning focus to the previously-focused element prior to activation regardless of the use of the `setReturnFocus` option. The option is now respected the same as it is when using focus-trap directly.

### Patch Changes

- 24704c7: Bump focus-trap dependency to 6.5.1 for bug fix to onPostDeactivate.

## 8.5.1

### Patch Changes

- b8d7071: Bump focus-trap dependency to 6.5.0 to get new features

## 8.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 6ee37fb: Bump focus-trap from 6.3.0 to 6.4.0. There should be no changes in behavior as a result of this upgrade.

## 8.4.2

### Patch Changes

- f9a6d1a: Throw an error if a Fragment is given as the child container (currently, it appears to work, but the trap is actually not activated because focus-trap can't find the DOM element for the Fragment "container"). (Fixes #268)

## 8.4.1

### Patch Changes

- a4c3105: Update PropTypes for clickOutsideDeactivates to match latest focus-trap.

## 8.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 8d58bc8: Bump focus-trap to v6.3.0

## 8.3.2

### Patch Changes

## 8.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 5d70831: Bump focus-trap to [6.2.1](https://github.com/focus-trap/focus-trap/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#621) for bug fixes.

## 8.3.0

### Minor Changes

- c4e4837: Remove the need for a child, update typings, update docs:
  - Remove the need for a child in `<FocusTrap />` when `containerElements` is used. The child was already being ignored anyway (when `containerElements` is used; if the prop is not used, then a single child is still required).
  - Update the typings related to the `children` prop to make it optional. Prop-types already had `children` as optional, however the use of `React.Children.only()` in all cases was still forcing the presence of a single child. That's no longer the case.
  - Add additional notes about the use of the `containerElements` prop in the documentation.

### Patch Changes

- 0836c6d: Fixing a bug where the focus trap may not have been set before it is unmounted #184

## 8.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 76ed007: Add ability to pass containerElements to focus-trap #179. This PR is made possible because of https://github.com/focus-trap/focus-trap/pull/217 and the released version 6.2.0 of focus-trap.

## 8.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 925dfd2: Update the react and react-dom peer dependencies from `^16.0.0` to `>=16.0.0` since this library works with React 17 as well as React 16.
- 01653da: Fix focus not always returning to correct node after setting `active` prop to `false`. #139
- 95f8ab6: Update focus-trap dependency from 6.1.2 to [6.1.4](https://github.com/focus-trap/focus-trap/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#614). Bug fixes only.

## 8.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 5994a8c: Bump focus-trap from 6.0.1 to 6.1.0. This new version of focus-trap provides a new `delayInitialFocus` flag that can be used to further customize trap behavior.

### Patch Changes

- 0562ef0: Change `prepublishOnly` script to `prepare` script so that it also runs if someone installs the package directly from the git repo (e.g. from your work in which you fixed a bug or added a feature you're waiting to get merged to master and published to NPM).

## 8.0.0

### Major Changes

- 513a2d3: **BREAKING**: Updated [focus-trap](https://github.com/focus-trap/focus-trap/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#600) dependency to new 6.0.1 release, which contains breaking changes. This update means it's also now using the latest version of [tabbable](https://github.com/focus-trap/tabbable/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#500), which also has breaking changes. See respective CHANGELOGs for details.

### Patch Changes

- 35040fa: Remove call for maintainers. @stefcameron and @maraisr hope to take up the charge. Additional help and contributors are most welcome for anyone interested!
- 513a2d3: Changed code formatting to use dangling commas where ES5 supports them.

## 7.0.1

- Fix: PropTypes definition now supports server-side rendering. [#83](https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap-react/issues/83)

## 7.0.0

- Add: Prop types for `<FocusTrap>`.
- Update: `focus-trap` dependency from 4.0.2 to [5.1.0](https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#510) for the latest features/fixes it provides. [#71](https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap-react/issues/71)
- **BREAKING** Update: Only React 16.0+ is supported going forward. [#55](https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap-react/issues/55)
- **BREAKING** Update: All dependencies updated to their latest versions.
- Fix: `children`'s type is `React.ReactNode`, not `React.ReactElement`. [#66](https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap-react/issues/66)
- Fix: Allow mutable object refs to be used for FocusTrap child. [#72](https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap-react/issues/72)
- Fix: `specifiedFocusTrapOptions.includes(optionName)` statement in `componentDidMount()` was causing an exception because `includes()` is not a function defined on `Object`.

## 6.0.0

- Update focus-trap to 4.0.2, which includes [a queue of traps](https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#400), so when a trap is paused because another trap activates, it will be unpaused when that other trap deactivates. If Trap A was automatically paused because Trap B activated (existing behavior), when Trap B is deactivated Trap A will be automatically unpaused (new behavior).

## 5.0.1

- Fix TypeScript declarations.

## 5.0.0

- **BREAKING:** `<FocusTrap>` now expects exactly one child element which can be any HTML element or other React component that contains focusable elements. The `tag` prop has been removed, as has support for additional props that are passed through to the `tag`, because it is no longer necessary: you should provide your own element, with whatever props you want, as a child of `<FocusTrap>`.

## 4.0.1

- Fix bug that caused `returnFocusOnDeactivate: true` to be ignored when using the `active` prop to activate & deactivate the focus trap.

## 4.0.0

- Update focus-trap to 3.0.0, which includes [a couple of behavior changes](https://github.com/davidtheclark/focus-trap/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#300). The key change is that focus management has been changed so that you can include tricky focusable elements like radio groups, iframes, and shadow DOM components in your trap ‚Äî¬†as long as the first and last focusable elements in the trap can still be detected by [Tabbable](https://github.com/davidtheclark/tabbable).
  - An effect of this change is that _positive tabindexes are no longer guaranteed to work as expected_. You should avoid these.

## 3.1.4

- Re-add TypeScript declarations.

## 3.1.3

- Remove `componentWillMount` usage.

## 3.1.2

- Fix TypeScript declarations so props are available on the imported namespace.

## 3.1.1

- Fix React import in TypeScript declarations.

## 3.1.0

- Add TypeScript declarations.

## 3.0.5

- Prevent error in IE edge cases when the previously focused element does not have a `focus()` function.

## 3.0.4

- Allow React v16 peer dependency.

## 3.0.3

- Introduce `dist/focus-trap-react.js`, where `src/` now compiles to, since React 15.5+ demands `class`es, so Babel-compilation. Which is actually a huge overhaul, though in semver it's just a patch.

## 3.0.2

- Fix handling of `focusTrapOptions.returnFocusOnDeactivate` for React-specific kinks like `autoFocus` on inputs.

## 3.0.1

- Upgrade `focus-trap` for important bug fix.

## 3.0.0

- Introduce `focusTrapOptions` prop (and remove redundancies).
- Upgrade to `focus-trap` v2.

## 2.1.1

- Allow React 15 as peer dependency.

## 2.1.0

- Upgrade `focus-trap` to add `escapeDeactivates` and `clickOutsideDeactivates` props.
- Allow arbitrary props passed through to the element itself.

## 2.0.1

- Move `react` to `peerDependencies` and remove `react-dom` dependency.

## 2.0.0

- Upgrade to React 0.14 and its companion ReactDOM.

## 1.0.0

- Initial release.
